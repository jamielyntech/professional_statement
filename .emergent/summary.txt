The previous AI engineer developed a Mystical Whispers Comics application iteratively. Initially, it involved a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, capable of parsing user stories into 3-6 text-based comic panels with a mystical theme. The first major enhancement introduced AI image generation, character uploads, and PNG export, along with a requirement for 5-10 visual panels per story. The development faced repeated challenges with Stability AI integration: incorrect API headers, content types, and output formats, leading to fallback to placeholder images despite the AI believing it was working. This back-and-forth was prominent. Finally, the root cause for image generation failure was identified as insufficient Stability AI credits. After the user confirmed fixing the credits, a direct Stability AI API test successfully returned a real image. The current state is poised to generate an end-to-end comic with real AI artwork, having resolved the credit issue.

The goal is to create a Mystical Whispers Comics application. Initially, it parses user stories into 3-6 text-based comic panels with scene descriptions, character actions, and dialogue. The application features a mystical comic theme with specific fonts and a pink/teal gradient background.

**Key features and enhancements:**
1.  **AI Storyboard Parser:** Transforms user stories into 5-10 structured comic panels, each including scene description, character actions, and dialogue.
2.  **AI Image Generation:** Generates AI artwork for each comic panel in a Mystical Watercolor style, incorporating a specific color palette (magenta #e74285, teal #20b69e, gold #fcd94c, navy #1a1330) and character likenesses (Jamie, Kylee).
3.  **Character Upload:** Allows users to upload images to use as references for characters.
4.  **Visual Comic Strip Output:** Composes generated images and text into professional-looking visual comic strips with traditional white speech bubbles (with mystical styling elements), yellow narration boxes, purple action boxes, and character tags.
5.  **PNG Export:** Enables downloading the completed comic strips as high-quality PNG images, suitable for social media (e.g., 4:5 Instagram aspect ratio).

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure Stability AI image generation consistently produces real images without falling back to placeholders. The user's repeated feedback confirms this is the main unresolved issue from their perspective, even though credit issues were resolved.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully performed a direct test with the Stability AI API (Chat Message 320), which returned a large base64-encoded image, confirming that the Stability AI service is now functional due to the user resolving the credit shortage. This means the backend is capable of generating real AI artwork.

The current work was in the process of creating a new comic (Chat Message 322) with real Stability AI images to fully verify the end-to-end workflow on the frontend, which would complete the user's primary request of having actual visual comic strips instead of placeholders. The frontend is prepared to receive and display these real images. The backend's  contains the logic for Stability AI integration (now with the correct headers and content type), a fallback to OpenAI (which previously failed due to ), and an enhanced placeholder image generation system using PIL, which was previously active when Stability AI credits were insufficient.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Generate a new comic via the frontend to confirm real Stability AI image generation end-to-end.
