The previous AI engineer meticulously developed the Mystical Whispers Comics application from a text-based MVP to a visual comic generator. The core challenge involved integrating Stability AI for image generation, which initially struggled with credit issues, then hardcoded responses, and subsequently MongoDB size limits when saving large images. These were systematically resolved by testing Stability AI directly, correcting API response logic, and implementing image compression.

Later iterations focused on refining the generated images based on user feedback. This included enhancing character likeness, improving image quality, ensuring adherence to mystical themes (Wealth Codex, not religious), and fixing image composition (cutoff, aspect ratio, speech bubbles). The process involved continuous prompt engineering, adjusting Stability AI parameters (CFG, steps, sampler), and debugging API call formats and dimensions. The final major pending task, explicitly requested by the user, is to implement Stability AI's image-to-image (img2img) functionality to use uploaded character photos for generating more accurate likenesses, which the AI engineer was just beginning to address. The journey reflects iterative problem-solving in a full-stack environment.

<product_requirements>
The Mystical Whispers Comics application aims to transform user stories into visually engaging, mystical-themed comic strips. Initially, it parsed stories into 3-6 text panels. The enhancements focus on:

1.  **AI Storyboard Parser:** Convert user stories into 5-10 structured panels with scene, action, and dialogue. It should now deeply integrate Wealth Codex themes, focusing on ancestral energy, tarot, candles, and astrology, avoiding religious content.
2.  **AI Image Generation:** Generate AI artwork in a Mystical Watercolor (or traditional comic style) using a specific palette (magenta, teal, gold, navy). Crucially, it must incorporate uploaded character likenesses (Jamie, Kylee) and produce modest, family-friendly content.
3.  **Character Upload:** Allow users to upload character reference images (e.g., Jamie, Kylee) for AI generation.
4.  **Visual Comic Strip Output:** Compose generated images and text into professional comic strips with traditional white speech bubbles, yellow narration boxes, and purple action boxes. Images must fit panels without cropping, and maintain consistent character appearances.
5.  **PNG Export:** Enable downloading high-quality PNG images (initially 4:5, later 1:1 for social media) of completed comics.

**Implementation Status:**
*   AI Storyboard parsing works for 5-10 panels.
*   AI image generation via Stability AI is functional, initially producing generic images, later improved for general mystical themes.
*   Character upload works, and text descriptions are used in prompts.
*   Visual comic strip output is working with speech bubbles, narration, and action overlays, with proper image sizing (1344x768 landscape).
*   MongoDB storage issues for large images resolved via compression.
*   Content moderation (no inappropriate content, no religious imagery) has been largely addressed through detailed negative prompts.
*   The final stage is to implement img2img to use uploaded photos for actual character likeness.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had successfully addressed multiple issues, including:
1.  **Stability AI Integration:** Confirmed Stability AI credits are working and it generates real AI images (not placeholders).
2.  **MongoDB Document Size:** Fixed by implementing image compression, allowing full comics with high-quality AI images to be saved successfully.
3.  **Image Quality & Theming:** Significantly improved AI artwork quality through prompt engineering, enhanced Stability AI parameters (CFG scale 15, 35 steps, K_DPM_2_ANCESTRAL sampler), and strong negative prompts. Thematic focus was shifted from generic mystical to Wealth Codex themes (tarot, candles, astrology, ancestral energy) and away from religious imagery.
4.  **Character Description & Differentiation:** Character prompts now correctly differentiate Jamie (dark hair) and Kylee (blonde hair) based on text descriptions.
5.  **Comic Layout & Speech Bubbles:** The frontend (, , ) was updated to display images at appropriate sizes (1344x768 landscape, ) without cutoff, and to overlay speech bubbles and action text on the images, creating a professional comic book appearance.
6.  **API robustness**: Handled failing Core v2beta API gracefully by falling back to SDXL and fixed some parameter issues for Core API.

The application can now successfully generate 4-6 panel comics with real, compressed AI images, mystical themes (Wealth Codex), differentiated characters (based on text descriptions), and proper comic book layouts with speech bubbles and narration overlays.

The user's most recent explicit request (Chat Message 316) is for the system to use the *actual uploaded character photos* (Jamie and Kylee) as visual references for the AI, rather than just text descriptions, by implementing Stability AI's image-to-image (img2img) functionality with a specified image strength (0.7-0.8). The AI engineer has just acknowledged this and is in the process of implementing this.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Implement Stability AI's img2img using uploaded character photos as references with an image strength of 0.7-0.8.
